  This website serves blobs publicly. A blob is a file containing any
  data; this system does not care about its internal structure and
  contents.
</p>
<p>
  A file can be uploaded and/or updated by anyone having an account in
  the system. This is a system for serving data, <strong>not</strong>
  for storing data long-term; do not assume that data will remain here
  forever.
